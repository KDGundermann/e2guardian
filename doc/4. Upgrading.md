# 4. Upgrading

When upgrading from one release to another there may be a chance that some configuration files or options may have changed.
Please read the release notes <> for changes in the different releases.

Before installing the new copy, first make a backup of your existing config
files. For example:
    cp -r /etc/e2guardian/ ~/e2guardian.old/

Then install the new copy.  After doing this, you should re-apply the old
settings, importing them by hand; i.e. any setting you had changed from the
default should be changed in the new e2guardian.conf file, and the same
for other files such as e2guardianf1.conf.  Every option should be documented
by comments in the default configuration file; these comments are one of the
best sources of information as to what a particular setting means.


## 4.1 Upgrading from DansGuardian

Both the main configuration file and the filter group configuration file(s) have changed!!

( ??? Check the script(s) in the migration_installation directory for help with this ???)
Read the e2guardian.release file which describes the main feature and enhancements in the different versions of e2guardian.

On the other hand, list files (phrase lists, domain lists, etc.) 
have not changed format, and should largely "just work".
